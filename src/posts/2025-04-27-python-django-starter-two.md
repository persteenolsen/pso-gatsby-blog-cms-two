Python Django and MySQL Starter Website serving a simple Blog and a list of Employees hosted at Vercel Cloud using Serverless Functions implementing DevOps by GitHub + Vercel

<a href="https://django-starter-two.vercel.app/" target="_blank" title="Django Website at Vercel">Try the demo...</a>

Django is using the architectural pattern Model-View-Template (MVT) which is a derivation of the pattern Model View Control (MVC) 

This Django Website is serving static content - secured by HTTPS

A simple Blog and a list of Employees demonstrates how to use Models (CRUD) by the Django Admin and display the Posts and the Employees by the Frontend

The files models.py and views.py are splitted up for showing how to scale the folder structure if the Django Website should grow with a lot of views and models

CI / CD by VS Code + GitHub + Vercel Cloud
