The Next.js framework being the "Static Site Generator" was used for creating this full stack web application serving as a login and registration system by having a client using the API Routes of Next.js getting the data / User credentials from a MongoDB with Mongoose ODM  ( Object Data Modeling ). The MongoDB is hosted at the Cloud Service Mongo Atlas. The Web App is secured by HTTPS and JWT Authentication.

This Next.js Jamstack Web Application is hosted at Vercel Cloud and uses continuous build and deployment
